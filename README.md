# Wine Quality Prediction (From Scratch ML)

## Overview
This project implements a wine quality prediction model **from scratch using NumPy**, without ML libraries like scikit-learn.  
The goal is to understand the mathematics and optimization behind regression models.

## Dataset
Wine Quality dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- Red wine and white wine physicochemical features
- Quality score prediction

Datasets are included in the `data/` folder for reproducibility.

## Approach
- Data loading and preprocessing using **pandas**
- Regression implemented manually using **NumPy**
- Model trained to learn parameters **w (weights) and b (bias)**
- Performance evaluated using error metrics and visualizations

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, pandas, matplotlib
- No external ML libraries used
